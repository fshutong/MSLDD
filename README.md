val_dataset (Lushan earthquake region dataset)

This package contains the original files of remote sensing images from three sources: UAV, Google earth, and PlaneScope belonging to the Lushan area, which are used to display the verification area. The shapes of these data are: UAV(data: (14746, 13366, 3), label: (14746, 13366, 1)), Google earth (data: (13500, 15000, 3), label: (13500, 15000 ,1)),PlantScope(data:(11000,10000,3), label:(11000,10000, 1))
